## Research Experience
### Undergraduate  
2015-2016 -- Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardi) stem sectioning using a microtome

2016 -- Seperation of chloroplasts from spinach leaves in sucrose solution for spectrophotometric analysis at different light wavelengths, to determine photosynthetic activity.

2017 -- Photosynthetic action spectra of etiolated green beans during greening.

### Graduate 
2017-2019 -- Greening rates and photosynthetic development of leaves in C3 and C4 plants, Studying how dark grown etiolated plants transition to a green state once introduced to light, using fluorescence and gas exchange measurements, by the use of an LI-6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System. Achlorophyllous leaves were measured at 0 days of light exposure, introduced to light, and measured daily for 10 days to track photosynthetic development and efficiency of photochemical processes.
